## Projects
### GhostLeaks

[Project Website](https://saitejaschintapall.wixsite.com/ghostleaks)

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/PontusAhlin/HorrorGame)

I am currently working in a team using Scrum to design a mobile VR horror game in Unity. This project involves creating models in Unity, using the C# programming language, and using Git for version control. In the game, you are a streamer going into an abandoned mental asylum aiming to gain likes by streaming monsters and escaping with your life. You can build the game onto your phone using the Unity game engine for both Android and IOS.

### Socket Programming

As a part of the IK1203 Network and Communication course at KTH, I was tasked with creating a concurrent server that could handle multiple HTTP requests. The project involved 4 tasks, each building on the previous ones. Task 1 was to create and implement a simple TCP client. Task 2 was extending the TCP client to handle multiple types of servers. Task 3 was implementing a local web server that can make HTTP requests. Task 4 was to implement the concurrent server, so multiple HTTP requests can be handled.

### ChipKit Game

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/gwendolym/is1200-mini-project-78)

I worked with a partner to program a game into a PIC32 ChipKit using C programming language and MIPS-Assembly. The game was presented at an exhibition along with other ChipKit projects. In this game, you are aiming to collect points by collecting the fruit on the screen while you are chased by multiple growing snakes.
